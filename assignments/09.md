# Build a more stable solution for retrying a stock reservation

The solution to assignment 6 wasn't great: we needed a call to `sleep()` to ensure that the second stock reservation was _more likely_ to succeed.
Sleep is good for us but not for the computer since we can't be sure it didn't sleep long enough, or too long.
We should instead build on top of the chain of events and keep the responsibility of retrying rejected reservations inside *Stock*.
When we receive goods we should check if there are previously rejected reservations that can now be accepted.

We need to change the following things:

1. The *Sales* process manager should no longer try to make a stock reservation after receiving goods.
2. Instead, the *Stock* process manager should do this work. Modify the `Balance` entity to loop over the reservations and accept the first one that matches the quantity of the received goods.
3. To make this work, we need to modify the `makeReservation()` method so it will also save rejected reservations. The `Reservation` child entity should also have some kind of flag so we can recognize if it has been accepted or rejected.

Finally, we'd like to write a system test that shows the process of making a sales order for goods we don't have in stock, for which a purchase order will be created. 
When the goods are received, the sales order should become deliverable. You can check this by actually delivering it, which should result in a successful response.
