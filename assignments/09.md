# Gain some insight into the long-running sales order process

It would be very helpful to see the current status of every sales order process. We already have the data (the `OrderStatus` objects and the status information they keep), so all we have to do is render a nice page in the *Sales* service, listing all the statuses.

To add some more detail to the process status you could keep a timestamp in the `OrderStatus` object and update it every time state transition occurs. The most convenient way to do this is store a Unix timestamp created with `time()`. `DateTime` doesn't let itself serialize with the tools used in this project. Show a formatted date in the list, based on this timestamp.
