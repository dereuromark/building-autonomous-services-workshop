# Turn `OrderStatus` into an actual state-tracker 

The `OrderStatus` object has a field for remembering which purchase order has been created for the sales order. But it doesn't remember the current state of the sales order process.

You could distinguish the following states:

- Sales order created
- Awaiting stock reservation
- Awaiting goods received (only if the reservation fails)
- Sales order delivered

Whenever there is a transition in the sales order process, like when the process manager automatically creates the purchase order, we should update and persist the `OrderStatus` object to remember its current state. This way, we can later gain some insight into the process. We could find out how many sales orders are waiting for their goods to be received.

Enhance `OrderStatus` to make this possible, and make the right calls in the *Sales* process manager.
