# The reservation pattern

To safely make stock-related transactions in a highly concurrent environment, we should leave the decision about "do we have enough of this product in stock" to the *Stock* service itself. This requires a bit of a different setup, but we can rely on two important techniques:

1. The Reservation pattern
2. A Process Manager

First, a *reservation* is like a two-step transaction. Given we have a sales order for 2 items of product A:

1. Make a reservation by calling the *Stock* service, asking it to *reserve* 2 items of product A.
2. Wait for a confirmation by means of an event that these items have been reserved, before taking further steps in the process.

At this point the *process manager* comes into play: we need to somehow remember that we've made a reservation and are waiting for a confirmation. We also need to take further steps, based on the outcome of the reservation ("reservation accepted" or "reservation rejected", because of insufficient stock).

To keep track of the order process and its current state, use the following description of events and commands (things that need to be done when an event comes in):

### Event: Sales order created

Make a stock reservation (provide product ID and ordered quantity).

### Event: Stock reservation accepted

Mark the sales order as deliverable.

### Event: Stock reservation rejected

Do nothing (yet).

Of course, we have to respond to this event too, but let's keep that for the next assignment.

## Step-by-step

Let's first prepare the *Stock* context to be able to handle reservations. The `Balance` entity has already been prepared for managing reservations. Take a look at `StockApplication::makeStockReservationController()` to find out how this works. If the reservation was successful, the controller persists the `Balance` object in the database. The next step is:

- When `makeReservation()` returns `true`, produce an event indicating that the reservation was accepted. As event data, provide the reservation ID.
- When `makeReservation()` returns `false`, produce an event that indicates that the reservation was rejected. As event data, provide all the data you have (i.e. the product ID, the quantity and the reservation ID).

Now we can start working on the the *Sales* process manager:

- Copy the `process_manager.php` script again from `Common` into `Sales`. Don't forget to define this new consumer in `docker-compose.consumers.yml` too.

The start signal for the process manager is going to be the "sales order created" event. We don't have it yet, so we must produce it first:

- Go to `SalesApplication::createSalesOrderController()` and produce a new "sales order created" event after the new sales order has been persisted. The data for this event should contain the sales order ID, the product ID and the quantity
- While you're working on the `createSalesOrderController()` just remove everything you did for assignment 04 (we're working on a better solution for that problem after all!).

Back to the *Sales* process manager: when it consumes a "sales order created event", it should make the stock reservation.

- You can invoke `StockApplication::makeStockReservationController()` by making a `POST` request to `http://stock_web/makeStockReservation`. Use the `HttpApi` tool for that, and provide all the data that the controller  needs as an array of form data:

```php
HttpApi::postFormData(
    'http://stock_web/makeStockReservation',
    [
        // form data...
    ]
);
```

One simple but important trick here is to *use the sales order ID as the reservation ID*. That way, when the "reservation accepted" event comes back in, we can link it back to the sales order for which the reservation was made.

Since `makeStockReservationController()` will produce new events, "reservation was accepted" and "reservation was rejected", the *Sales* process manager should listen for these events. For now, it should listen to the "reservation accepted" event. 

- If the "reservation was accepted" event comes in, the *Sales* process manager should mark the sales order as deliverable (i.e. fetch the corresponding `SalesOrder`, call `markAsDeliverable()` on it and then save it).
- Finally we can remove that "TODO" in `SalesApplication::deliverSalesOrderController()`, including the line below it...

Wow! A lot of work, but when you're done, you've successfully implemented a complicated sales process. Run `bin/cleanup` to start with an empty database and stream, then `bin/restart` to restart all consumers, fix possible bugs, and enjoy the result!

You can test the flow of the "happy path" as follows:

- Create a purchase order.
- Go to "Receive Goods" and mark the purchase order as "received".
- Create a sales order with a quantity less than the quantity of the purchase order.
- Note that upon refreshing the list of sales orders, the created sales order has automatically been marked as "deliverable".
