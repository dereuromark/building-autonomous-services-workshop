# Build a more stable solution for retrying a stock reservation

The solution to assignment 7 wasn't great: we needed a call to `sleep()` to ensure that the second stock reservation was _more likely_ to succeed.
Sleep is good for us but not for the computer since we can't be sure it didn't sleep long enough, or too long.
We should instead build on top of the chain of events and keep the responsibility of retrying rejected reservations inside *Stock*.
When we receive goods we should check if there are previously rejected reservations that can now be accepted.

We need to change the following things:

1. The *Sales* process manager should no longer try to make a stock reservation after receiving goods.
2. Instead, the *Stock* process manager should do this work. The `Balance` entity should loop over the rejected reservations and accept the first one that matches the quantity of the received goods.
3. `Balance` has already been prepared to do this work. As you can see in `makeReservation()`, it already keeps a list of rejected reservations. The `processReceivedGoodsAndRetryRejectedReservations()` method is a better alternative to `increase()`.

Eventually, we'd like to have additional scenarios in `dashboard.feature` to document the new behavior and to make sure it keeps working.
To find out what scenarios to write, first test the feature in the browser.
While doing so, keep a list of the steps you take.
For example:

1. I add a product to the catalog
2. I create a sales order for this product
3. I see that ...

We need two additional scenarios:

1. A purchase order will be created when a sales order requires stock that we don't have.
2. When the goods are received for such a purchase order, the sales order will be marked deliverable.
