## Revisiting the stock-level-changed event

Something is conceptually not right: when we create a sales order, the system makes a stock reservation. If the reservation gets accepted, the stock level will be changed (it will be decreased), to make sure that somebody else can't order the same goods.

However, the stock level reported on the dashboard will not be updated yet. That's because the "stock level changed" event gets produced inside the *Stock* process manager, which responds to the "sales order was delivered" event.

So we should make two changes:

1. The *Stock* process manager should no longer produce a "stock level changed" event after receiving a "sales order delivered" event.
2. After dispatching the "reservation was accepted" event, the `makeStockReservationController()` should also dispatch a "stock level changed" event.
